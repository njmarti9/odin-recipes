    <h3>Creamy Delicous Chicken</h3>

    <p>As someone who loves food with big, BIG flavours, it’s no surprise that Indian is one of my favourite foods. A
        good curry and binge watching Netflix is pretty much my idea of a perfect Friday night.</p>

    <p>As much as I love making Indian food at home, sometimes I find the list of ingredients daunting. It’s easy enough
        to make once I gather all the ingredients, but that’s where I usually fall short because it requires a trip to
        an Indian grocery store – and my closest one is a fair drive away.</p>

    <p>Butter Chicken is one of the few exceptions. I was elated when I discovered a Chef recipe for Butter Chicken and
        realised how easy it is. But more importantly, you can get all the ingredients from any supermarket. Yes!</p>


    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <h5>Marinade</h5>
    <ul class="uolist">
        <li>½ cup plain yoghurt, full fat</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp tumeric powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>½ tsp chilli powder or cayenne pepper powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger, freshly grated </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1.5 lb / 750 g chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite size pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Curry</h5>
    <ul class="uolist">
        <li>2 tbsp (30 g) ghee or butter, OR 1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato passata (aka tomato puree)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy / thickened cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1¼ tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol class="olist">
        <li>Optional blitz: for an extra smooth sauce, combine the Marinade ingredients (except the chicken) in a food
            processor and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Marinade: Combine the Marinade ingredients with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or
            up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).</li>
        <li>Cook chicken: Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the chicken out of the
            Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from the chicken (but don’t pour the Marinade left in the
            bowl into the fry pan). </li>
        <li>Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over (it
            doesn’t really brown because of the Marinade).</li>
        <li>Sauce: Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn
            down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt. </li>
        <li>Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with basmati rice.</li>
    </ol>
