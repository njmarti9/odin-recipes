    <h3>Sweet, Spicy, and Crispy! What more could you want?!</h3>

    <p>
        Shocker: We’re really into low-maintenance weeknight recipes. Because getting every single pot and pan dirty on
        a Tuesday night isn’t exactly our idea of fun. What is? This sweet, spicy and delightfully sticky firecracker
        chicken with rice that’s on the table in under an hour.
    </p>

    <p>The trick is twofold: For starters, the chicken is coated in cornstarch and egg before a quick pan-fry (it’s less
        messy and greasy than deep-frying). And the sauce is a simple combination of condiments you likely already have
        in your kitchen, so it comes together on the stovetop in practically no time at all.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <h5>Chicken</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, chopped</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Sauce</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup sriracha</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon crushed red-pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced, divided</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds and steamed rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Chicken: </strong>In a large bowl, season the chicken with salt and pepper. Add the
            cornstarch and toss well to coat. In a medium bowl, crack the eggs and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. When the oil is hot, dip each piece of chicken into the
            egg and then add to the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken, turning a few times, until each piece is evenly golden brown and fully cooked, 7 to 9
            minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Sauce: </strong>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the
            garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the sriracha, rice vinegar, brown sugar, crushed red-pepper flakes and half of the scallions. Bring the
            mixture to a simmer, stirring constantly, and cook for 1 minute; remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>When the chicken is done cooking, transfer it from the pan to a large bowl. Add the sauce, and toss well to
            combine.</li>
        <li>Garnish with the sesame seeds and remaining scallions. Serve with the rice.</li>
    </ol>
